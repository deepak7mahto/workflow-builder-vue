### Data Structre 

```
Nested Json Data Structure is used with this sample data having parent child relationship

[{ name: 'Parent', id: 1, children : [
    { name: 'Child 1', id: 2, children: []},
    { name: 'Child 2', id: 3, children: []}
]}]

For the current use case this data structure is sufficient , later we can enhance this if we require more fields
